Timelapse panner using Arduino and stepper motor for Go Pro cameras

Timelapse panner based on Arduino

This repository is to store my files for a timelapse panner.
Intended for a GoPro type camera, it does also support a heavy DSLR, but use with caution.

The original software isnâ€™t mine, but did need to be tweaked slightly.
I have included my files for laser cutting.

I used an Arduino Nano and a base board which are cheap off ebay.  This effectively turns a Nano into an Uno form factor.  The holes cut into the base will allow for an UNO to be fitted.

I also added a bleeper to alert me when the timelapse is up, this is optional.
